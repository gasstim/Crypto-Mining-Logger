# Crypto-Mining-Logger
Simple cli program to track my personal mining
Just a command line interface that interacts with flypool's z-cash pool and 
nanonpool's monero pool. 
It will save your addresses and total mined of each coin. Simply run the program each day and just type
"xmr" or "zec" for it to update your coin balance and fetch the current dollar value of the amount mined that day.
It will timestamp and print out the amount of each coin mined along with it's dollar value.
When it asks if you'd like to save, type yes or no. If you plan on logging both coins, say no on the first one.
You can manually save if you accidentally skip these prompts by typing save.
